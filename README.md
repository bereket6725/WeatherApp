# WeatherApp

An app that gives you the five day forecast and comforts you with pusheen and cat facts :)

// TODO: List of APIs
1. Accesses openWeatherMaps API's 5 day forecast'
2. Accesses the CatFacts API 
3. Uses iOS standard Model-View-Controller architecture.

Currently doesn't support error-handling, the user interface leaves a little to be desired :smile:
