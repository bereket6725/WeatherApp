     "The average litter of kittens is between 2 - 6 kittens.",
     "A cat's normal pulse is 140-240 beats per minute, with an average of 195.",
     "An estimated 50% of today's cat owners never take their cats to a veterinarian for health care. Too, because cats tend to keep their problems to themselves, many owners think their cat is perfectly healthy when actually they may be suffering from a life-threatening disease. Therefore, cats, on an average, are much sicker than dogs by the time they are brought to your veterinarian for treatment."
